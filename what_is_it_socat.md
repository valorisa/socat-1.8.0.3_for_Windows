socat (SOcket CAT: netcat on steroids) is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these.
These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, named pipes, and pseudo
terminals.

Some of the examples of using socat are :

- TCP relay (one-shot or daemon)
- External socksifier
- Shell interface to Unix sockets
- IPv6 relay
- Netcat and rinetd replacement
- Redirecting TCP-oriented programs to a serial line
- Establishing a relatively secure environment (su and chroot) for running client or server shell scripts inside network connections.
